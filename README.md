# Overview

This web app is an expense tracker that is designed to track your expenses. It takes a category, amount, and description of each expense and saves it to a list. These items will be available on the expense report page.
The report generates pie charts based of of you input expenses and allows you to view your total expenditure and your income to spending ratio.

This software was created as a solution for me to be able to track my own expenses. It also is for all to track expenses and improve financial literacy.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
