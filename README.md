# Overview

This web app is an expense tracker that is designed to track your expenses. It takes a category, amount, and description of each expense and saves it to a list. As each item is submitted, the expense will be shown on the screen.

This software was created as a solution for me to be able to track my own expenses. It also is for all to track expenses and improve financial literacy.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
